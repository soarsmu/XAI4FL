# XAI4FL: Enhancing Spectrum-Based Fault Localization with Explainable Artificial Intelligence
Manually finding the program unit responsible for a fault is tedious and time-consuming. To mitigate this problem, many fault localization techniques have been proposed. In this study, we propose a novel idea that first models the SBFL task as a classification problem of predicting whether a test case will fail or pass based on spectra information on program units. We subsequently apply eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to infer the local importance of each program unit to the prediction of each executed test case. Such a design can automatically learn the unique contributions of failed test cases to the suspiciousness of a program unit by learning the different and collaborative contributions of program units to each test case's executed result. As far as we know, this is the first XAI-supported SBFL approach. We evaluate the new approach on the Defects4J benchmark dataset.
